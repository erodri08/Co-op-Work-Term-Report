                <h2 class="subtitle">About Scotiabank</h2>
                <p>Scotiabank, also known as The Bank of Nova Scotia, was founded in 1832 and is one of Canada's largest financial institutions, serving over 25 million customers globally. They offer a broad range of financial services including personal banking, commercial banking, investing and wealth management. Their head office is located in Toronto, at 44 King street, but they have various offices across the world. The two offices I worked at during my term were the downtown head office and Scotiabank's Eglinton Campus in Scarborough.</p>

                <p>My team's work was focused on developing solutions to support cybersecurity operations and improve processes across the bank. We used a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform called Cortex XSOAR, developed by Palo Alto Networks. This platform is designed to help cybersecurity teams manage, automate and coordinate responses to cybersecurity incidents through automated workflows called playbooks.</p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">Skills I Developed</h2>
                <p>In this role, I set out to deepen my technical skills, build my confidence communicating in a technical business environment and gain exposure to security tools and workflows. Some of the skills I developed and strengthened during this term were:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="skill-title">Python:</span> This was the main programming language I used throughout my role, building automations within Cortex XSOAR. I used python to process large datasets, interact with REST APIs and generate structured reports using the Pandas library. I was first introduced to these tools for a data analysis project in a first year software design course and have developed my proficiency in them throughout various different courses at the University of Guelph, which allowed me to complete my work more effectively this term.</li>
                    
                    <li><span class="skill-title">Documentation:</span> I was tasked with creating confluence documentation for my work, so that it could be used by my teammates after my term was over. My coursework in group projects gave me a strong foundation in how to document my work, which I further developed in a professional setting. I also did some external reading online to understand the best way to structure my documentation.</li>
                    
                    <li><span class="skill-title">Object-Oriented Programming:</span> I applied OOP principles when developing automations in CORTEX XSOAR, using classes and instances to encapsulate functionality and improve code maintainability. My coursework at the University of Guelph introduced me to OOP concepts such as inheritance and encapsulation, and my work at Scotiabank reinforced my understanding of these concepts.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <hr class="section-divider">
                
                <h2 class="subtitle">Major Project</h2>
                <p>My main project throughout the term was reporting on and synchronizing the UAT and Production environments of the SOAR platform used by my team. This project involved:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Developing Python automations using Pandas, difflib, and REST API calls to generate automated comparison reports between environments</li>
                    <li>Creating a detailed change management plan assessing impacts, testing procedures, rollout steps, and recovery plans</li>
                    <li>Presenting findings and recommendations to my team, including team leads and our director</li>
                    <li>Implementing the approved synchronization plan through automated XSOAR playbooks</li>
                    <li>Building automations that updated the team's jira with the environment synchronization status and metadata associated about the content in each environment</li>
                    <li>Creating Confluence documentation so my work could be reused and maintained by the team</li>
                    <li>Updating Jira regularly to communicate progress to the team</li>
                </ul>
