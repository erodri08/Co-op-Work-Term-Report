                    <h2 class="subtitle"></h2>
                    <p>For my May to August co-op term this year, I worked as a Reporting Analyst with Intelligo Partners, on-site at their client, Guardian Capital. The main focus of my role was to develop investment reports using SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). I worked in a hybrid model during this term, spending two days a week in the office, and three working remotely from home. Over the Summer, I developed a range of technical and professional skills that I can apply to my future career. This page will take a deeper look into the projects I worked on, the skills I strengthened, and the overall experience I gained throughout the term.                    </p>

                    <h2 class="subtitle"></h2>
                    <p>Intelligo Partners is a technology consulting firm that specializes in providing management consulting and project implementation services for asset and wealth managers. The client, Guardian Capital Group, is a global financial services company that is headquartered at 199 Bay Street, in Toronto’s Commerce Court West. Guardian provides investment management services to institutional, retail, and private high-net-worth clients in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Caribbean.                    </p>
                    <p>At Guardian, I was a part of the “Eagle Project Team”, working to migrate the company's various business lines from an older investment accounting system called Pacer, to a more modern platform called Eagle. This project involved using SQL and Python to develop data conversion scripts and creating new processes for the portfolio managers at Guardian.                    </p>
                  
                    <h2 class="subtitle"></h2>
                    <p>As mentioned above, my title was Reporting Analyst, and my key responsibility was to design, develop and maintain SSRS reports containing investment accounting and performance data for portfolio managers at Guardian Capital. The primary skills I used on this job were:                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>SQL: I used this programming language to write complex queries that would extract, transform and validate data from a data lake across various different tables of investment data. I first learned this skill in my CIS 2750 course at the University of Guelph, where I used it to join tables in a database and query data based on user input. This co-op allowed me to dramatically deepen this knowledge, applying it to much larger datasets in a real-world scenario.                      </li>
                      <li>SSRS & VisualBasic: I used this BI tool to design the reports and write expressions for calculations and formatting. SSRS was an entirely new technology that I learned during this co-op term. To improve my learning outside of the workplace, I enrolled in an online Udemy course strengthening my knowledge of this tool, and improving the quality of my work. The certificate I earned from this course is included below.                         <br> <img src="udemy.png" alt="certificate" width="600" height="auto">                      </li>
                      <li>Problem Solving: This was essential for debugging queries and optimizing performance. I had practiced this skill in various university courses, and this practice prepared me well for the work term, making it easier to break down problems and find the root of errors in my code.                      </li>
                      <li>Communication: I met with portfolio managers at Guardian to gather requirements from non-technical stakeholders and later present completed reports to them. My Software Design courses at the University of Guelph gave me a strong foundation in this skill, allowing me to effectively translate user needs into technical solutions.                       </li>
                      <li>Agile: Beyond report development, I also contributed to improving my team’s agile process by setting up and maintaining a Jira board to track our progress. Having studied agile methodologies in a Software Design course, I was able to translate that classroom knowledge to my everyday work.                      </li>
                    </ul>   
                    
                    <h2 class="subtitle">Learning Goals</h2>
                    <p>Prior to the start of my work term, I had outlined four goals for myself to complete, to strengthen my skills and become an effective contributor to the company I worked for. </p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsubsubtitle">Learning Goal 1: Technological Literacy  </h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Goal: To strengthen my proficiency in SSRS and SQL, to develop reliable and professional investment reports.                      </li>
                      <li>Action Plan: Consult with team members regularly for feedback on report structure and data accuracy and practice writing optimized SQL queries to extract data                      </li>
                      <li>Measure of Success: To successfully develop SSRS reports using SQL queries that meet stakeholder requirements with no additional revisions.                      </li>
                      <li>Reflection: During this work term, I have successfully strengthened my skills in using SQL to navigate large databases and building high-quality financial reports in SSRS. I met with various business stakeholders to determine user needs and revised my work based on these meetings. Through working with my colleagues and the learning I did on my own, I was able to get a stronger grasp of SQL, allowing me to further refine the SSRS reports. By the end of the term, I was able to develop reports that met stakeholder requirements with minimal necessary revisions.                      </li>
                    </ul>   

                    <h3 class="subsubsubtitle">Learning Goal 2: Integrative Communication                    </h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Goal: Improve my ability to translate technical reporting outputs into clear and actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.</li>
                      <li>Action Plan: Participate in meetings where I present and explain reporting outcomes and work to prepare presentations that aid in stakeholder understanding </li>
                      <li>Measure of Success: Receive positive feedback on my communication style and clarity, and to have stakeholders demonstrate understanding of the material I presented through questions and feedback </li>
                      <li>Reflection: Throughout the work term, as I worked with business stakeholders on SSRS reports, I gained insightful knowledge on presenting technical work to non-technical stakeholders. I was given the opportunity to demonstrate the reports I generated to it's users, instructing them how to use the reports and gathering feedback on technical features that needed to be added or revised. I received positive feedback from my supervisor on my presentation of these reports and at the end of my work term, the users of the reports that I worked on were able to successfully use my reports, based on the information that I had communicated to them.                       </li>
                    </ul>   

                    <h3 class="subsubsubtitle">Learning Goal 3: Problem Solving                    </h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Goal: To build my ability to identify data discrepancies or inefficiencies in report generation and resolve them independently.                      </li>
                      <li>Action Plan: Maintain a log of issues found in datasets or reports and implement fixes to errors in datasets using self directed problem solving</li>
                      <li>Measure of Success: Successfully reduce errors in reports by provided deadlines</li>
                      <li>Reflection: I strengthened my critical and creative thinking skills by proactively addressing data inconsistencies in SSRS reports and SQL queries. I used various trackers to identify my progress and used repeated testing to identify the root causes of issues in the reports. I was able to implement solutions to reduce errors and improve the accuracy of the information displayed.                      </li>
                    </ul>

                            <p>
                                Scotiabank, also known as The Bank of Nova Scotia, was founded in 1832 and is one of Canada’s largest financial institutions, serving over 25 million customers globally. They offer a broad range of financial services including personal banking, commercial banking, investing and wealth management. Their head office is located in Toronto, at 44 King street, but they have many offices across the world. The two offices I worked at during my term were the head office and Scotiabank’s Eglinton Campus in Scarborough.

                        My team’s work was focused on developing automated processes and integration solutions to support cybersecurity operations and improve processes across the bank. We used a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform called Cortex XSOAR, developed by Palo Alto Networks. This platform is designed to help cybersecurity teams manage, automate and coordinate responses to cybersecurity incidents through automated workflows called playbooks.

                    <h3 class="subsubtitle">Skills I Developed</h3>

                    <p>
                        In this co-op I set out to deepen my technical skills, gain exposure to security tools and workflows and build my confidence communicating in a technical business environment. Some of the main skills I developed and strengthened during this term were: 
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Python:</strong> This was the main programming language I used through my role, building automations within Cortex XSOAR. I used python to process large datasets, interact with REST APIs and generate structured reports using the Pandas library. I was first introduced to these tools for a data analysis project in a first year software design course and have developed my proficiency in them throughout various different courses at the University of Guelph, which allowed me to complete my work more effectively this term. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Documentation:</strong> At the end of my term, I had to develop confluence documentation for my work, so that it could be used by my teammates after my term was over. My coursework in group projects gave me a strong foundation in how to document my work, which I further developed in a professional setting. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Containerization:</strong> My team used Docker container environments in their development workflows. While containerization was not a major focus of my work, my experience with working in a container environment in my second year CIS 2750 course allowed me a better understanding of why teams use this tool to ensure consistency in code compilation. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Object-Oriented Programming:</strong> I applied OOP principles when developing automations in CORTEX XSOAR, using classes and instances to encapsulate functionality and improve code maintainability. My coursework at the University of Guelph introduced me to OOP concepts such as inheritance and encapsulation, and my work at Scotiabank reinforced my understanding of these concepts.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <h3 class="subsubtitle">Major Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        My main project throughout the term was reporting on and synchronizing the UAT and Production environments of the SOAR platform. This project involved:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developing Python automations using Pandas, difflib, and REST API calls to generate automated
                            comparison reports between environments</li>
                        <li>Creating a detailed change management plan assessing impacts, testing procedures, rollout
                            steps, and recovery plans</li>
                        <li>Presenting findings and recommendations to my team, including team leads and our director</li>
                        <li>Implementing the approved synchronization plan through automated XSOAR playbooks</li>
                        <li>Building automations that updated the team’s jira with the environment synchronization status and metadata associated about the content in each environment</li>
                        <li>Creating Confluence documentation so my work could be reused and maintained by the team</li>
                        <li>Updating Jira regularly to communicate progress to the team</li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <h3 class="subsubtitle">Velocity Intern Program Experience</h3>
                    <div style="display: flex; gap: 40px; align-items: flex-start; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                        <div style="flex: 1;">
                            <p>
                                In addition to my technical work responsibilities, I was one of over 150 interns across Scotiabank and Tangerine in their Velocity program, which serves to strengthen intern’s transferable skills and build connections to peers in different business areas. One memorable highlight of this program’s events was Velocity Community Day, where I worked with other interns to build bicycles for children supported by the Boys and Girls Club. This experience was both rewarding and meaningful, as it allowed me to contribute to a cause that supports those in need. The photo on the left shows my team and I with the bicycle we built together.

                    <h3 class="subsubtitle">Learning Goals</h3>
                    <p>
                        At the beginning of the term, I outlined five learning goals to guide my development:
                    </p>
        
                    <h3 class="subsubsubtitle">Learning Goal 1: Written Communication</h3>
                    <p>
                        I focused on improving my ability to document code and technical processes clearly for both
                        technical and non-technical audiences. By the end of the term, my documentation required minimal
                        revisions and was successfully used by my teammates without additional explanation.
                    </p>
        
                    <h3 class="subsubsubtitle">Learning Goal 2: Cybersecurity Tools & Workflows</h3>
                    <p>
                        Through hands-on exposure and discussions with my team, I developed a strong understanding of how
                        SIEM and SOAR platforms integrate to support automated cybersecurity incident response within a
                        large financial institution.
                    </p>
        
                    <h3 class="subsubsubtitle">Learning Goal 3: Organization & Time Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        I used Jira to track tasks, manage priorities, and communicate progress. This helped me stay
                        aligned with team expectations and reliably meet deadlines in a fast-paced environment.
                    </p>
        
                    <h3 class="subsubsubtitle">Learning Goal 4: Problem Solving</h3>
                    <p>
                        I strengthened my ability to analyze complex problems and design automation-based solutions,
                        particularly through my work synchronizing production and UAT environments.
                    </p>
        
                    <h3 class="subsubsubtitle">Learning Goal 5: Oral Communication</h3>
                    <p>
                        By participating in stand-up meetings and presenting a change management plan to leadership, I
                        improved my confidence and effectiveness when communicating technical work verbally.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="subsubtitle">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        This work term was both challenging and rewarding, and I am grateful for the opportunity to gain
                        exposure to cybersecurity operations within a global financial institution. It allowed me to
                        apply academic knowledge in a real-world setting and provided a new perspective on software
                        development within cybersecurity.
